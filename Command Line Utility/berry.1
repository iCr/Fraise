.TH BERRY 1 LOCAL

.SH NAME
berry - A command-line utility for Strawberry

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B berry [file] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION

With berry you can start the application Strawberry by just writing berry with no options. If you write something after berry it considers that to be the path to the file or, if you write more than one path, the paths to the files. You can use the standard wildcards e.g. * and ~ for your home folder. If you don't specify a full path it adds the current working directory to what you write. If it can't find any of the specified files, it first creates them and then opens them. (Note that if you use a wildcard and it can't match a file to that it creates a file including the wildcard character as a character in the path, e.g. if you write berry ~/Desktop/*.jsp and there aren't any .jsp-files on the desktop it creates a file called *.jsp on the desktop.)

.SH EXAMPLES

berry - opens the application

berry foo - opens foo from the current directory in Strawberry

berry ~/foo - opens foo from your home folder in Strawberry

berry ~/Desktop/fooDoesNotExist - creates the file fooDoesNotExist on your desktop and opens it in Strawberry

berry ~/Desktop/*.php /etc/*.conf - opens all the files that end with .php on the desktop and all files that ends with .conf in the /etc folder
